        <p>
            I was born Nov. 30th 1984 in San Marcos, TX. I currently reside in San Antonio, TX and work
            in
            the
            oil field
            industry. The company I work for is based out of Oklahoma City and we provide many forms of
            communication
            to companies out in the oil field. I have two beautiful and amazing children and to top it
            off
            an
            equally
            amazing and beautiful wife.

            I am also currently a part-time student at UTSA and I am studying on becoming a web
            developer.
            My
            drive in
            life is my family and the need and want to provide an amazing life for them. I am
            extremely close to my father, Al Serrano who is now retired from a 37yr career with Wal-Mart
            where
            he
            reached
            Regional Vice President status. I would have to credit him for instilling the values of hard
            work
            and
            family.
